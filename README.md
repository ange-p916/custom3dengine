Currently making a 3d engine.

Its supposed to be a small light weight 3d engine made in c++. 
So far it just has basic rendering capabilities.

The idea is to make a mini unity3d version.

It will support a scene view, meshes, textures, shaders, serialization etc. 

How to build:
Clone the repo.
Delete build folder
create build folder with cmd: mkdir build, cd build, cmake ..
then open the .sln file within the build folder and you should be able to run it within visual studio.
